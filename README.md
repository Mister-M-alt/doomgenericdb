# Doomdb

This is the doom DB implementation that is working.

## How to us install it?

### Library

The buildserver will build a .so library.
The build will create library that needs to be integrated into the rootfs.

### WADs

Be careful! WADs are propriatery artworks. Use open ones only. 

The FreeDoom are inside the repo under wads folder. They need to be copied over
to the /dbaudio/data/ (can be changed later)
